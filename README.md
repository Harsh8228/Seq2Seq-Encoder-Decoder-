# Seq2Seq-Encoder-Decoder

🚀 Encoder-Decoder Example
A simple sequence-to-sequence model using TensorFlow/Keras for English-to-French translation! 🇬🇧➡️🇫🇷
This project demonstrates an encoder-decoder architecture with LSTM layers for learning translation patterns from a tiny dataset.

✨ Features
📖 Tokenization & Padding for text preprocessing
🔄 LSTM-based Encoder-Decoder Model
🏗️ Training & Inference Models for translation
🎯 Small-scale dataset for quick experimentation
⚡ Understand model limitations and expand upon them

🔍 Limitations
⚠️ Tiny dataset – not suitable for real-world translation
⚠️ No attention mechanism – may struggle with long sequences

🎯 Further Improvements
💡 Improve translation accuracy!
🛠️ Add attention mechanism or expand the dataset.
